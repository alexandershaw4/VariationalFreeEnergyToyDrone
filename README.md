# Variational Free Energy Toy Drone (MATLAB)

Active-Inference control for a 2D “toy drone” that **infers hidden state** and **chooses actions by minimising expected free energy (EFE)**. It demonstrates pragmatic–epistemic trade-offs (goal-seeking vs. information-seeking) with clear visualisations of **beliefs vs. true state** and optional **obstacles**.

## ✨ Features

- **Variational Free Energy (VFE) inference** over latent drone state.
- **Action selection via Expected Free Energy (EFE)** with tunable epistemic drive.
- **Rollout / look-ahead planning** in a simple continuous 2D world.
- **Obstacle avoidance** example.
- Clean separation between the **agent** (Active Inference policy) and **environment loop**.
